Prompt for Replit AI (Redesign UI to be Binance-style, elegant trading interface)

I already have a working full-stack crypto arbitrage web app with:

Auth (login/signup)

User dashboard (balances, P/L, portfolio, arbitrage positions, charts, live opportunities)

Admin panel, deposits/withdrawals, etc.

Now I want you to redesign the entire frontend UI/UX so that it looks and feels similar in style to the Binance website and trading interface at https://www.binance.com/en — dark, elegant, professional — but without copying exact code or text. Keep all existing backend logic, routes and APIs as they are.

Please update the existing frontend components, don’t start a new project.

1. Overall Design Language (Binance-inspired, not identical)

Use a dark trading theme:

Background: very dark navy/black (#02040A, #050816, or similar).

Surface/cards: slightly lighter dark (#0B1020, #111827, etc.).

Color system:

Primary accent similar to Binance yellow: #F3BA2F.

Profit: green (#16A34A).

Loss: red (#DC2626).

Text primary: almost white (#F9FAFB).

Text secondary: muted gray (#9CA3AF).

Typography:

Use a modern, clean sans-serif like Inter / DM Sans / Plus Jakarta Sans.

Strong hierarchy: big numbers for balances, smaller labels, clear titles.

Apply numeric font features for aligned digits if possible.

Create a small design system (colors, font sizes, radii, shadows, spacing) and reuse it across all screens.

2. Global Layout & Navigation

Redesign the main layout similar in spirit to Binance:

Top navigation bar (sticky):

Left: logo/icon + app name (e.g. “ArbiTradeX”).

Center/right: links like “Dashboard”, “Markets”, “Portfolio”, “History”, “Support”.

Right: user avatar with dropdown (Profile, Settings, Logout), notification bell icon, language/currency selector (even if non-functional, visually present).

Dark background, slight border at the bottom, subtle hover states on nav items.

Content area:

Full width, constrained max-width on large screens.

Consistent padding, 24–32px on desktop.

Footer:

Minimal, dark, with small text links similar to Binance (Terms, Privacy, etc.).

3. User Dashboard – Binance-style Trading Overview

Make the user dashboard feel like a Binance “Overview” + simple “Markets” section combined.

Top section (hero strip):

Left:

“Total Balance” in large type.

Currency selector (USD/USDT etc., can be visual only).

Right:

Quick actions: Deposit, Withdraw, Transfer (reuse existing logic for deposit/withdraw; transfer can be a placeholder for now).

Summary card row:

Cards similar to Binance “Wallet Overview”:

Total Balance

Realized P/L

Unrealized P/L

Active Positions

Each card:

Dark card, subtle border, soft shadow.

Large numeric value.

Label below (muted).

Small icon in top-right.

Profit cards use green + small mini up-trend icon; loss cards use red.

Main grid (desktop):

Left (2/3 width):

Tabbed panel: Portfolio / Positions / History

Right (1/3 width):

Live Markets / Opportunities panel, like Binance markets list.

4. Portfolio & Positions (Table Design)

For Portfolio and Arbitrage Positions, use Binance-like tables:

Dark table with alternating row hover highlight.

Columns:

Asset (logo + symbol + small name).

Quantity.

Entry price.

Current price.

Value (USD).

P/L (USD) with green/red emphasis.

P/L (%) with colored pill and ▲ / ▼ icon.

Status (for positions): pill style (open, closed).

Table header:

Slightly brighter background, uppercase small labels, subtle bottom border.

Use right-aligned numeric columns, consistent toLocaleString formatting, 2–4 decimal places where appropriate.

5. Live Markets / Opportunities Panel

Make a Binance-style markets sidebar:

Vertical list of assets, each row like:

Left: symbol + name.

Middle: last price.

Right: 24h change% with green/red pill.

For arbitrage opportunities:

Use a compact card style:

Asset + “Spread X%”.

“Buy on [Exchange] @ price”

“Sell on [Exchange] @ price”

Spread badge with green background and small label.

Add a small filter bar above: asset dropdown, min spread dropdown, search field.

6. Charts – Trading Terminal Look

For the price charts:

Dark chart background, subtle grid lines.

Line or candlestick charts with Binance-like colors:

Up moves / green candles for increases.

Down moves / red candles for decreases.

Add a header above chart:

Asset symbol & name.

Current price.

24h change (%) with color + icon.

Timeframe buttons: 1H / 4H / 1D / 1W (even if they all call the same data for now).

Use smooth animations, hover crosshair, and elegant tooltips.

7. Authentication Pages (Login / Signup)

Make login & signup forms match the new Binance-style:

Centered card with dark background, rounded corners, soft shadow.

Large title (“Welcome back”, “Create your account”).

Inputs:

Rounded, light inner background.

Clear focus state with yellow border or subtle glow.

Primary button:

Binance-style yellow bar across width.

Below: small muted text + link to switch between Login/Signup.

Keep the same API calls; only styling/layout changes.

8. Buttons, Inputs, and Micro-interactions

Buttons:

Primary: yellow with dark text, rounded, hover darken + shadow.

Secondary: dark background, light border, hover border accent.

Inputs:

Dark outer, lighter inside, subtle borders, clear focus ring.

Add small transition for hover/focus on cards, table rows, buttons:

transition: all 0.15s ease-out;

For notifications (like “Order has been closed in profit”), use Binance-style toast:

Dark background, left colored bar (green/red), appear at top-right.

9. Responsive Behaviour

Desktop: multi-column layout as above.

Tablet: two columns where possible; move markets panel under portfolio if needed.

Mobile:

Stack sections: summary cards (scroll horizontally), quick actions, portfolio, positions, markets, charts.

Tables become horizontally scrollable cards or condensed rows.

10. Implementation Rules

Do NOT change backend routes, controllers, or DB structure.

Do NOT remove any existing functionality (deposits, arbitrage logic, admin, WebSockets).

Only modify:

React components / HTML structure

CSS / Tailwind / styling logic

It’s fine to create new reusable UI components (e.g. SummaryCard, MarketRow, TradingTable, TradingChartLayout) as long as they plug into the existing pages.

The goal is that, after your changes, the app:

Feels like a Binance-inspired trading platform

Looks high-end, trustworthy and professional

Still behaves exactly like the original app in terms of data and features.

You can stop when the UI across login, dashboard, portfolio, markets, charts and main navigation is visually consistent with this Binance-style design.
