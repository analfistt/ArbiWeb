Build a full-stack crypto arbitrage web application with the following requirements. Use a modern tech stack that works well on Replit (for example: Python FastAPI or Node.js/Express for backend, and React or a simple responsive frontend using HTML/CSS/JS + a modern UI library like Tailwind or Bootstrap). Use SQLite as the database.

Core Concept

This is a demo arbitrage trading platform where:

Users can sign up, log in and see a personal dashboard.

Admin has a Back Office / Admin Panel that controls everything, including:

user balances

user profit/loss

status of withdrawals and deposits

The actual arbitrage logic can be simulated / mocked (no need to execute real trades), but the UI should look like a real arbitrage platform.

Main Features
1. Authentication & Users

Implement Login / Sign Up with:

Email

Password (hashed)

Optional username

Store users in SQLite.

Use session or JWT for authentication.

Users can only see their own data.

Admin user:

Seed a default admin user (for example: email: admin@site.com, password: Admin123!).

Admin has access to a Back Office.

2. Database (SQLite)

Create at least these tables:

users

id

email

password_hash

is_admin (boolean)

created_at

wallets or balances

id

user_id (FK)

total_balance_usd (float)

available_balance_usd (float)

created_at

updated_at

portfolio_positions

id

user_id (FK)

asset_symbol (e.g. BTC, ETH, USDT)

average_entry_price

quantity

current_value_usd

profit_loss_usd

profit_loss_percent

last_updated

transactions

id

user_id (FK)

type (deposit, withdrawal, trade, adjustment)

amount_usd

status (pending, completed, rejected)

tx_hash_or_reference (string, nullable)

created_at

admin_adjustments

id

user_id (FK)

delta_balance_usd

note

created_at

You may add more tables if needed.

3. Landing Page (Public)

Create a marketing landing page inspired by the layout and style of this page:
https://oddsjam.com/betting-tools/arbitrage

Do NOT copy text, but use similar structure:

Hero section with:

Big headline about Crypto Arbitrage Trading

Subheadline explaining that the platform finds opportunities across multiple exchanges.

Strong “Call to Action” buttons:

“Sign In to Dashboard”

“Sign Up”

Sections:

“How it Works” – simple 3-4 steps explaining:

Deposit crypto or USD

System finds arbitrage between exchanges

You see your profits in your portfolio

“Supported Exchanges” – show logos / names like:

Binance

Kraken

Coinbase

(You can add more dummy exchanges)

“Why Us” – highlight:

Real-time market data

Automated arbitrage engine (simulated)

Simple dashboard for tracking profits

Design requirements:

Clean, modern UI/UX

Responsive design (works on desktop and mobile)

Use neutral dark / light theme suitable for finance/crypto.

Add a top navigation bar with:

Logo / site name (e.g. “ArbiTradeX” placeholder)

Links: “Home”, “Features”, “Dashboard”, “Sign In”, “Sign Up”

4. User Dashboard (Client Area)

After login, user sees a dashboard with:

Top Summary Cards

Total Balance (USD)

Realized Profit/Loss (USD)

Unrealized Profit/Loss (USD)

Number of active positions

Portfolio Section

Table showing each asset:

Asset (symbol + icon if possible)

Quantity

Average entry price

Current price

Current value (USD)

P/L (USD)

P/L %

P/L % should be:

Green with an up arrow when positive.

Red with a down arrow when negative.

Arbitrage Opportunities Section

Table or cards showing simulated arbitrage opportunities across exchanges, for example:

BTC: Buy on Binance @ $X, Sell on Kraken @ $Y, Spread Z%

ETH: Buy on Coinbase @ $X, Sell on Binance @ $Y, Spread Z%

Show multiple exchanges like:

Binance

Kraken

Coinbase

(and a few more dummy names)

These can be mocked but should look realistic using real-time prices from an external crypto price API.

Balance & Wallet Section

Show user’s current balance.

Buttons:

Deposit

Withdraw

Deposit Integration with NowPayments

Integrate NowPayments API (or at least scaffold the integration with clear placeholders and sample code).

User flow:

User clicks “Deposit”.

Chooses currency/amount.

System creates a payment via NowPayments API.

Show deposit address or payment link.

For this demo, you can simulate completion, but code should be structured to easily plug in the real NowPayments API keys and callbacks.

Withdraw Functionality

User clicks Withdraw and submits:

Amount

Destination address (string)

Save withdrawal request as a record in transactions with status = pending.

Admin can later mark it as completed or rejected in the Back Office.

On completion, balance is decreased.

Crypto Prices & Charts

Use a reliable crypto price API, for example CoinGecko or Binance public API, to get real-time prices.

Show:

Line chart for major coins (BTC, ETH, etc.) on the dashboard.

Current prices in a ticker or table.

Use a standard charting library (like Chart.js or similar) on the frontend.

5. Admin Back Office

Create a separate Admin Dashboard (protected route, only for is_admin = true) with these functions:

User Management

List of all users.

View a single user’s:

Profile

Balance

Portfolio

Transactions

Buttons to:

Adjust user balance (increase/decrease).

Mark withdrawal as completed or rejected.

Manually set or update “profit/loss” for demonstration.

Control User Profits

Admin should be able to set or override:

profit_loss_usd

profit_loss_percent

After admin changes these values, the user’s dashboard and portfolio should update accordingly with green/red percentages and arrows.

Transaction Monitoring

Table of all deposits and withdrawals with filters by status.

Options to approve/reject withdrawals.

Basic Analytics (Optional but nice to have)

Total number of users.

Total deposits, withdrawals.

Total “platform P/L”.

6. UI/UX Requirements

The overall design should look professional, like a real crypto SaaS dashboard.

Use clear typography, spacing, and cards.

Use different colors for:

Profits: green, up arrow.

Losses: red, down arrow.

Navigation:

Public pages: Landing page.

Auth pages: Login, Sign Up.

Authenticated user pages: Dashboard, Portfolio, Transactions, Settings.

Admin pages: Admin Dashboard (with sub-sections).

7. Technical Details & Structure

Use SQLite as the persistent storage, with migration or initialization scripts.

Provide a clear README that explains:

How to run the project on Replit.

How to set environment variables (e.g. NOWPAYMENTS API keys, JWT secret).

Default admin credentials.

Organize the code cleanly:

backend/ (API routes, DB models, auth logic)

frontend/ (React or static HTML/JS for UI)

Or a simple monolith structure but clearly separated routes/files.

Make sure:

API endpoints are RESTful.

Authentication is secure enough for a demo (no plain text passwords).

Protect sensitive routes (dashboard, admin) with proper auth checks.

Goal:
Generate all the necessary backend, frontend, database models, and integration stubs so that I have a working demo crypto arbitrage trading platform with:

SQLite DB

Login/Sign Up

User dashboard with balance, portfolio, arbitrage opportunities, charts

Deposit via NowPayments (integration scaffold)

Withdraw button and flow

Admin Back Office that controls user profits, balances, and withdrawals

Modern, clean, responsive UI/UX

Landing page similar in concept to OddsJam arbitrage tools page, with Sign In / Sign Up buttons leading to the auth pages.

You can stop here and I’ll test the generated project.
