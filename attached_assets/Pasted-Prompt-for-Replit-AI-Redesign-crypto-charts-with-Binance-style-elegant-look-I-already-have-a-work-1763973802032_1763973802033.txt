Prompt for Replit AI (Redesign crypto charts with Binance-style elegant look)

I already have a working crypto arbitrage web app with price charts for coins (BTC, ETH, etc.).
The charts are functional but visually basic.

I want you to redesign ONLY the chart visuals so that they look more like a professional Binance-style trading chart: dark, refined, and elegant, while keeping all existing data sources and APIs the same.

Do NOT change the backend or the data shape – only the frontend chart components and styling.

1. Chart type & layout

For each asset (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.), use either:

A candlestick chart (preferred), or

A smooth line/area chart with filled gradient, if candlesticks are hard with the current library.

Make the chart fill its container nicely with:

No unnecessary padding around.

A compact, trading-terminal feel.

Use the existing charting library in the project (e.g. Chart.js, Recharts, etc.), but configure it to match these visual requirements.

2. Dark trading theme

Apply a dark theme similar to Binance:

Chart background: very dark (#050915 or #020617).

Chart plot area slightly lighter than the page background.

Axes and gridlines:

Gridlines: thin, subtle lines in #1E293B or similar.

Axis labels: soft gray (#9CA3AF).

No bright borders; keep everything minimalistic and flat.

3. Candles / line colors

Positive (up) candles or up-moves:

Color: strong green (#16A34A or similar).

Negative (down) candles or down-moves:

Color: strong red (#DC2626).

For line/area charts:

Line color: asset-specific accent (e.g. yellow for BTC, blue for ETH) but still consistent with the dark theme.

Area under the line: gradient from the line color to transparent, with low opacity.

Example (if using Chart.js):

Gradient fill from rgba(243,186,47,0.35) to rgba(243,186,47,0) for BTC.

4. Tooltips & crosshair

Add modern, minimal tooltips like Binance:

Dark tooltip background (#020617).

Thin border #1F2937.

Rounded corners.

Values aligned and easy to read.

Show:

Time / date

Open / High / Low / Close (for candles) or Price (for line)

Volume if available (optional).

Add a vertical crosshair / hover line that follows the cursor across the chart.

Highlight the corresponding candle/point on hover.

5. Axes & labels

X-axis:

Show time labels (e.g. “10:30”, “14:45” or dates “Nov 23”).

Use a subtle font size, no rotation unless necessary.

Y-axis:

Show price labels with 2 decimal places (or adaptive).

Use toLocaleString or the library’s formatter for thousands separators.

Remove any axis titles that clutter the chart; the asset name and current price should appear above the chart instead.

6. Header bar above each chart

For each asset chart, add a small header above the chart:

Left:

Asset symbol and name (e.g. BTC / Bitcoin).

Current price in large text.

Right:

24h change (%) with:

Green and ▲ icon if positive.

Red and ▼ icon if negative.

Optional timeframe buttons: 1H, 4H, 1D, 1W (they can reuse the existing data endpoints or mock different granularities).

Style this header to match the rest of the dashboard (dark card style, premium typography).

7. Performance & responsiveness

Ensure charts remain smooth in interactions.

On smaller screens:

Reduce grid detail slightly.

Keep tooltips readable.

Make the chart height adaptive (e.g. 220–260px on mobile, taller on desktop).

8. Implementation details

Reuse existing data fetching logic and data structures.

Only modify the chart components and related styles.

If needed, create a reusable <TradingChart /> component with props:

assetSymbol

data (OHLC or price series)

currentPrice

changePercent24h

Plug this component into the existing dashboard where charts are currently rendered.

Goal:
After your changes, the crypto price charts should look like a compact, elegant Binance-style trading chart:

Dark, clean, and professional.

Clear visual distinction between up/down moves.

Smooth tooltips and crosshair.

Beautiful integration with my new overall dashboard design.
