I already have a working crypto arbitrage web app with:

User authentication

User dashboard with balance cards, portfolio, arbitrage positions, price charts, live opportunities

Admin Back Office, deposits, etc.

Now I want you to redesign ONLY the user dashboard UI/UX to look much more elegant, modern and professional, inspired by Binance’s trading dashboard style (dark, clean, high-contrast), while keeping all existing backend logic, APIs and database structures the same.

Please update the existing frontend components, don’t rewrite the whole project or break the routes.

1. Overall Design Direction

Use a dark theme similar in feel to Binance:

Very dark background (#02040A, #050816, or similar).

Card backgrounds in slightly lighter dark tones (#0B1020, #111827, etc.).

Accent colors:

Primary accent: gold / yellow (similar to Binance, e.g. #F3BA2F).

Profit: green (#16A34A or similar).

Loss: red (#DC2626 or similar).

Typography:

Clean, modern sans-serif font (e.g. Inter, DM Sans, or similar).

Clear hierarchy: big bold numbers for balances, smaller muted labels.

Use subtle shadows, rounded corners, and smooth hover states.

Provide responsive layout that looks excellent on desktop and still works on tablet/mobile.

If you already use Tailwind or another utility framework, leverage it. Otherwise, create a small, consistent design system (colors, spacing, typography) and reuse it across components.

2. Dashboard Layout (User)

The main dashboard should feel like a trading overview screen. Suggested structure:

Top bar:

Left:

App logo / name (e.g. “ArbiTradeX”) with a small icon.

Right:

User avatar / initials with dropdown (Profile / Logout).

Icon buttons for:

Notifications (bell icon)

Settings (gear icon)

Background: dark with slight blur or gradient.

Main content grid (desktop):

Row 1: Summary cards (4 cards)

Total Balance

Realized P/L

Unrealized P/L

Active Positions

Row 2:

Left: Portfolio & Positions (tabs).

Right: Live Opportunities.

Row 3:

Left: Price charts (BTC, ETH etc.).

Right: Recent activity / transactions or deposit/withdraw quick actions.

Maintain the same data but reorganize it in a visually appealing layout.

3. Summary Cards (Top)

Redesign the top 4 cards to look like Binance “account overview” style:

Dark card background with soft border (e.g. 1px border in #1F2933).

Large number (e.g. $1,200.00) in bright white.

Small label below (USD Value) in muted gray.

For P/L cards:

Show an inline mini trend icon:

Up-right arrow + green for positive.

Down-right arrow + red for negative.

Prefix profits with + and losses with -.

Add small subtle icons on each card (wallet, chart-line, lightning, etc.).

Example visual style (pseudo):

Card height ~ 120px, border-radius ~ 16px, padding ~ 20–24px.

4. Portfolio + Positions (Center Left)

Create a tabbed section:

Tabs at the top:

Portfolio

Arbitrage Positions

On desktop, this panel should be the main center element.

Portfolio tab:

Table with columns:

Asset (with small circular logo icon).

Quantity.

Avg. entry price.

Current price.

Value (USD).

P/L (USD).

P/L (%).

Styling:

Dark table, alternating row hover highlight.

Profit numbers in green with ▲ icon, loss in red with ▼ icon.

Small sparkline chart in the last column (optional, if simple to implement).

Arbitrage Positions tab:

Same data you already show, but:

Show Route as “Kraken → Binance” with arrow icon.

P/L column with strong color (green/red), bigger font.

Small “status pill” for open / closed (e.g. green outline for open, gray for closed).

Date column formatted nicely (23 Nov 2025, 12:45).

5. Live Opportunities (Right Panel)

Transform the current “Live Opportunities” into a modern vertical list of cards, similar to Binance’s market list:

For each opportunity:

Show:

Asset symbol and name (BTC, Bitcoin).

Spread badge (e.g. 2.40% Spread with green pill).

Lines like:

Buy on Binance @ $86,332.51

Sell on Kraken @ $88,427.49

Card design:

Compact, rounded, dark background with hover elevation.

Small right-aligned “potential profit” or “view details” button or icon.

Add a filter bar above the list:

Dropdown for asset filter (All, BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.).

Dropdown for minimum spread (e.g. > 0.5%, > 1%, etc.).

Simple search input by symbol.

6. Price Charts (Bottom)

Redesign the price charts area to feel more like a mini trading terminal:

Use a dark chart theme:

Dark background.

Grid lines in faint gray.

Axis labels in soft white.

Provide a tab switcher above the chart:

BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.

For each selected asset, show:

Price chart (line or area chart).

Current price and 24h change (% and color).

Place this on the left of the bottom row, with a card container consistent with the rest of the design.

7. Deposit / Withdraw Quick Actions

Add a fixed “Action bar” either:

At the top-right of the dashboard content or

As a horizontal bar below the summary cards.

Include:

Large primary button: Deposit (using primary accent color).

Secondary outline button: Withdraw.

These should open the existing modals / flows (don’t change backend logic, just reuse current handlers).

Style them to look like Binance primary/secondary buttons:

Rounded corners.

Slight glow on hover.

Bold font.

8. Micro-interactions & Hover States

Add subtle hover animations for:

Cards (slight scale and shadow).

Buttons (background + border change).

Table rows (row highlight).

Use CSS transitions for smoothness (e.g. transition: all 0.15s ease-out;).

For P/L indicators, you can add a tiny pulse animation on significant changes (optional).

9. Mobile / Tablet Responsiveness

Adjust layout for smaller screens:

Collapse top 4 summary cards into a horizontal scroll or 2x2 grid.

Stack sections vertically:

Summary cards

Action bar (Deposit/Withdraw)

Portfolio / Positions

Live Opportunities

Charts

Make tables scrollable horizontally with sticky headers.

Ensure no critical text is clipped.

10. Implementation Rules

Keep all existing functionality and data fetching unchanged.

Do not rename API endpoints or remove fields.

Only change:

Frontend components’ structure (HTML/JSX).

Styling (CSS/Tailwind/Styled Components, depending on project).

If you need to create new reusable components (e.g. SummaryCard, PositionsTable, OpportunitiesList, PriceChartCard), do so, but plug them into the existing dashboard route.

Also:

Clean up any unused legacy styling that conflicts with the new dark theme.

Make sure no runtime errors are introduced.

Goal:

After your changes, the user dashboard should look like a polished, Binance-inspired trading dashboard:

Dark, elegant, and consistent.

Professional finance / trading look.

All current data (balance, P/L, positions, opportunities, charts) still present, but displayed in a much more attractive and modern way.
