📌 Prompt for Replit AI (Add Timeframe Selector to Crypto Charts)

I already have working price charts for assets (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.) in my crypto arbitrage app.
Now I want to add a timeframe selector component to the charts, similar to professional crypto exchanges like Binance.

🎯 Feature Requirements

Add a visual timeframe selector above each chart with the following options:

1m | 15m | 1H | 1D | 1W | 1M


These represent:

1m = 1 minute

15m = 15 minutes

1H = 1 hour

1D = 1 day

1W = 1 week

1M = 1 month

When the user clicks one of these, the chart must update automatically using the selected timeframe.

Use the same asset prices API already used in the project (CoinGecko / Binance API / etc.).

If multiple endpoints are needed, use the appropriate query parameters (like interval=1h, interval=1d, etc.).

If exact granular data isn’t available, resample/coalesce to match timeframe visually.

The timeframe selector must:

Highlight the active selection (yellow/gold accent, similar to Binance).

Be responsive (mobile-friendly).

Use hover and active styles consistent with the dark UI theme.

🎨 UI/UX Requirements

Place selector bar above the chart header or between asset info and the chart.

Use pill-shaped or tab-shaped buttons with:

Rounded corners

Subtle hover glow

Selected state color = #F3BA2F (Binance yellow)

Unselected state = muted gray text on dark background.

Example styling:

.timeframe-option {
  padding: 6px 12px;
  border-radius: 6px;
  cursor: pointer;
  font-weight: 500;
  transition: all 0.15s ease-out;
}

.timeframe-option.active {
  background-color: #F3BA2F;
  color: #000;
}

🔧 Implementation Guidelines

Create a reusable component:
<TimeframeSelector />

Props:

currentTimeframe

onChange(timeframe)

Emits a callback when clicked.

Integrate it into your chart container component (<TradingChart /> or similar).

Trigger a refetch of the chart data whenever the timeframe changes.

Keep existing chart rendering code untouched, only feed it updated data.

🧪 Testing

Verify that chart updates instantly when clicking any timeframe.

Confirm that if an API request fails temporarily, the UI handles it gracefully (loading state / fallback).

Ensure that mobile layout does not overflow horizontally.

🚫 Do NOT change:

Backend routes or DB logic

Existing dashboard layout except for adding this feature

Deposit/withdraw functionality

Admin trading logic

Only update the chart UI and data-fetch behavior.

🎯 Final Outcome

After this change, the user will be able to click:

👉 1m · 15m · 1H · 1D · 1W · 1M

And the chart will update in real time like a real crypto trading platform (e.g., Binance, Bybit, Coinbase Pro).
