You are editing my existing Replit project of a crypto arbitrage website.

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT change anything in the project except the price chart logic and its immediate UI controls.
- Do NOT touch the login / auth logic, routing, HTML structure outside the chart area, CSS files, or any existing texts.
- Keep all existing styles, components, and APIs that are already used in the project.

Goal:
Make the coins price chart truly time-based and always up to date, with selectable time ranges.

Requirements:

1. Time-based historical data
- The chart must display prices according to their real timestamps.
- If 4 hours ago the price was different, the chart must show that historical difference for the selected time range.
- Use the SAME data source / API that the project is already using for coin prices.
- If the current API already supports historical prices (candles/ohlc), use it with proper parameters (symbol, interval, limit, startTime/endTime).
- If only current prices are available, implement a simple in-memory (or persisted if already available in the project) time-series buffer that stores [timestamp, price] every time data is fetched, and use that buffer for the chart.

2. Time range selector
Add a time range selector for the chart with the following options:
- 24 hours
- 12 hours
- 1 hour
- 30 minutes
- 15 minutes
- 1 minute

Implementation details:
- The selector can be buttons or a dropdown, but must look consistent with the existing design.
- Default selection can be 1 hour (or the current default used by the project).
- When the user chooses a range (e.g., 24h), query or filter the data so that the chart only shows data points from “now - selected_range” until “now”.
- Make sure the chart is fully redrawn or updated when the user switches range.

3. Live updates
- The chart must keep updating in real time (or at the same interval the app already uses for fetching prices).
- When a new price arrives:
  - Add a new data point with the correct timestamp.
  - Remove old points that are outside the currently selected time range.
- Do NOT reset or clear the whole chart on every update; only append/remove points as needed so the chart looks smooth.

4. X-axis & formatting
- The X-axis of the chart must be time-based.
- Format labels according to the zoom level:
  - For 1 minute / 15 minutes / 30 minutes / 1 hour: show time (HH:mm or similar).
  - For 12 hours / 24 hours: show both date and time where needed.
- Make sure tooltips show exact timestamp and price.

5. Code location & safety
- Only modify the component / file that manages the price chart and its data fetching logic.
- If the project uses a library like Chart.js, Recharts, ECharts, etc.:
  - Reuse the existing chart instance and configuration where possible.
  - Just adjust the data arrays (labels, datasets) and add the time range selector behavior.
- Keep all existing props, state names, and function signatures unless absolutely necessary.

6. UX details
- While loading data for a selected range, show a small loading state only in the chart area (spinner or “Loading…” text).
- On API error, show a small non-intrusive message near the chart, but do NOT break the app.

Now:
1. Locate the existing price chart component and its data fetching logic.
2. Implement the time-based history, range selector (24h, 12h, 1h, 30m, 15m, 1m), and live updates exactly as described above.
3. Do not change anything else in the project.
